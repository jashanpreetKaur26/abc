    <p>Bumblebees vary in appearance, but are generally plump and densely furry. They are larger, broader and
      stouter-bodied than honeybees, and their abdomen tip is more rounded. Many species have broad bands of colour, the
      patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly
      pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed
      into a tube. Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have part of the body covered in black fur,
      while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen. Sizes are very variable even
      within species; the largest British species, B. terrestris, has queens up to 22 mm long, males up to 16
      mm long, and workers between 11 and 17 mm long. The largest bumblebee species in the world
      is
      B. dahlbomii of Chile, up to about 40 mm long, and described as "flying mice" and "a monstrous fluffy
      ginger beast".</p>


    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>

    <p>Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates, and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than
      other bees, although a few lowland tropical species exist. A few species (B. polaris and B. alpinus) range
      into
      very cold climates where other bees might not be found; B. polaris occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high
      Arctic, along with another bumblebee B. hyperboreus, which parasitises its nest. This is the northernmost
      occurrence
      of any eusocial insect. One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their
      body
      temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of "shivering" and radiative cooling from the abdomen
      (called
      heterothermy). Other bees have similar physiology, but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most
      studied
      in bumblebees. They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude. Bumblebees have a
      largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia (apart from Tasmania where they have been
      introduced) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara. More than a hundred years ago they were also
      introduced to New Zealand, where they play an important role as efficient pollinators.</p>
